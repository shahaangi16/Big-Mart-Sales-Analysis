# Big-Mart-Sales-Analysis
Performed EDA and built sales prediction models using Random Forest and XGBoost with RandomizedSearchCV hyperparameter tuning on BigMart dataset (8,500+ records, 16 categories, 10 outlets).
Engineered key features including Outlet Age, MRP Price Groups, and Item Visibility correction; applied K-Means clustering to segment items and customers by sales behavior.
Cleaned data using Pandas – handled missing values in Item Weight & Outlet Size, fixed 700+ inconsistent labels and 600+ zero-visibility entries.
